Introduction
============

This project is a test harness for testing an 8-bit register following Ben Eater's 8 bit register on [eater.net](https://eater.net/).

The test hardness uses an Arduino to interface with the bus, control lines, and clock of the 8-bit register. Pin mappings at the top of the source may be modified to adapt to any Arduino.
